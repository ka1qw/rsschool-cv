### About me

- A few months ago I graduated from the Russian State Hydrometeorological University with a degree in applied Informatics;

- While learning, an attempt was made to create a project using Python. A Telegram-bot was almost created to navigate university buildings. Unfortunately, there was not enough enthusiasm and desire for full implementation;

- Since the third year, I had experience working at a private programming school for children. The main subject was learning the Python language. I worked there for 2 years and changed my occupation after graduation.

- I took up studying frontend development several times, but usually I didn't have enough time. Now I want to try again in the rs-school format;

- My goal **is to learn something new and get good skills in it**.
